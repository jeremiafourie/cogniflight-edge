# Vision Processing Service

The Vision Processing service performs **real-time** facial landmark detection and fatigue analysis using hardware-accelerated MediaPipe. It operates reactively, only processing camera data when a pilot is actively detected by the face recognition system.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Performance**: Ultra-fast processing with 10-20ms latency
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Optimized MediaPipe with 75% frame scaling for speed
- **Reactive Activation**: Only runs when pilot is detected (via CogniCore subscriptions)
- **Fast EAR/MAR Calculation**: Vectorized computations for instant blink detection
- **Robust Resource Management**: Camera automatically starts/stops based on pilot presence
- **Optimized Threading**: Producer-consumer pattern with larger buffer sizes

## Inputs

### CogniCore Subscriptions
- **`pilot:{pilot_id}`**: Pilot status changes from face recognition and HTTPS client
  ```json
  {
    "pilot_id": "1234567",
    "active": true,
    "profile_loaded": true,
    "loaded_by": "https_client",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "flightHours": 2500.0,
    "baseline": {...},
    "environmentPreferences": {...},
    "timestamp": 1234567890.123
  }
  ```

### Hardware Inputs
- **Camera Feed**: 640x360@30fps via rpicam-vid
- **Processing Resolution**: 480x270 (75% scaling for speed)

## Processing

### 1. Reactive Pilot Detection
```python
def handle_pilot_change(hash_name: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Automatically starts/stops processing based on pilot active status"""
    pilot_id = data.get('pilot_id') if data else None
    is_active = data.get('active', False) if data else False
    
    if pilot_id and is_active and not self.running:
        # Pilot activated - start vision processing
        self.start_processing_for_pilot(pilot_id)
    elif pilot_id and not is_active and self.running:
        # Pilot deactivated - hand camera back to face recognition
        self.handover_camera_to_face_recognition()
```

### 2. Hardware-Accelerated Landmark Extraction
- **MediaPipe Face Mesh**: 468 facial landmarks with hardware acceleration
- **Frame Scaling**: Process at 75% resolution (480x270) for 4x speed improvement
- **Memory Optimization**: Read-only frames with pre-allocated buffers
- **Quality Filtering**: Face bounding box validation

### 3. Fast EAR Calculation (Eye Aspect Ratio)
```python
def fast_ear_approximation(self, eye_landmarks: List[Tuple[float, float]]) -> float:
    """Fast EAR approximation - only essential calculations for speed"""
    points = eye_landmarks
    
    # Simple vertical/horizontal ratio (much faster than full EAR)
    vertical_dist = abs(points[1][1] - points[5][1]) + abs(points[2][1] - points[4][1])
    horizontal_dist = abs(points[0][0] - points[3][0])
    
    if horizontal_dist > 0:
        ear = vertical_dist / (2.0 * horizontal_dist)
        return max(0.05, min(0.6, ear))  # Simple bounds check
    else:
        return self.baseline_ear
```

### 4. Real-Time Processing Loop
- **Ultra-fast loop**: 5ms delay for real-time responsiveness
- **No-face processing**: 1ms delay when face not detected
- **Frame processing**: Immediate processing with minimal delays
- **Blink detection**: Instant response to rapid eye movements
