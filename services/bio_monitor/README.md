# Bio Monitor Service

The Bio Monitor service provides continuous Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) heart rate monitoring with advanced physiological analysis AND real-time alcohol detection. It connects to configured heart rate sensors and MQ3 alcohol sensor, publishing comprehensive biometric data to CogniCore for system-wide use.

## Key Features

- **Standard BLE Protocol**: Compatible with BLE Heart Rate Profile devices

### Alcohol Detection
- **Real-time Alcohol Monitoring**: MQ3 sensor integration with GPIO 18
- **Inverted Logic Handling**: Properly handles MQ3 module's inverted digital output
- **30-Second Warmup Period**: Allows sensor heater to stabilize before detection
- **2-Second Debounce Logic**: Prevents false positive detections
- **Instant Publishing**: Immediately publishes alcohol detection events to CogniCore

### System Integration

## Architecture

The service follows a dual-sensor monitoring pattern with intelligent connection management:

### Initialization
1. Initialize CogniCore connection and logging
2. Initialize MQ3 alcohol sensor with GPIO 18 (gpiozero)
3. Initialize heart rate analyzer for advanced metrics
4. Run MQ3 sensor diagnostics to verify proper connection

### Continuous Monitoring Loop
1. **Alcohol Sensor**: Check MQ3 sensor every second (inverted logic: LOW = alcohol detected)
2. **Heart Rate Sensor**: Attempt BLE connection to configured HR sensor
3. **Data Processing**: Process and analyze biometric data in parallel
4. **Publishing**: Stream real-time data to CogniCore Redis infrastructure
5. **Connection Management**: Automatic retry on HR sensor connection failures
6. **System Health**: Send periodic watchdog notifications to systemd

## Hardware Requirements

### MQ3 Alcohol Sensor Module
- **GPIO Pin**: GPIO 18 (Physical Pin 12) - Digital Output
- **Power Requirements**: 5V (150mA for heater element)
- **Ground**: Pin 34 (GND)
- **Logic**: **INVERTED** - HIGH = clean air, LOW = alcohol detected
- **Detection Range**: 0.05-10 mg/L alcohol concentration
- **Warmup Time**: 30 seconds for stable operation
- **Threshold**: Adjustable via onboard potentiometer

### BLE Heart Rate Sensor
- **Service**: Heart Rate Service (UUID: 0x180D)
- **Characteristic**: Heart Rate Measurement (UUID: 0x2A37)
- **Notifications**: Must support heart rate measurement notifications
- **Configuration**: MAC address specified in `config.DEFAULT_HR_SENSOR_MAC`

### Compatible Heart Rate Devices
- Standard BLE heart rate monitors
- Chest strap monitors (Polar, Garmin, etc.)
- Wrist-based HR monitors with BLE support
- Any device implementing the standard BLE Heart Rate Profile

## Data Processing

### Alcohol Detection Processing
The MQ3 sensor uses inverted digital logic for detection:

```python
def read_sensor(self):
    """Read alcohol sensor and publish detection if found"""
    # Read digital output (LOW = alcohol detected, HIGH = clean air - inverted logic)
    alcohol_detected = not self.sensor.is_pressed  # Invert GPIO reading

    if alcohol_detected and debounce_check_passed:
        # Publish alcohol detection to CogniCore hash
        self.core._redis_client.hset("alcohol_detected", "latest", str(alcohol_data))
```

**Key Processing Steps:**
1. **GPIO Reading**: Read GPIO 18 state using gpiozero Button
2. **Logic Inversion**: Invert reading (LOW = alcohol detected)
3. **Warmup Check**: Only process readings after 30-second warmup
4. **Debounce Logic**: 2-second minimum interval between detections
5. **Immediate Publishing**: Publish detection event to CogniCore Redis

### Heart Rate Data Parsing
```python
def parse_hr_data(data: bytearray) -> int:
    """Parse heart rate data from BLE heart rate measurement."""
    flags = data[0]
    if flags & 0x01:  # 16-bit HR value
        hr = int.from_bytes(data[1:3], byteorder='little')
    else:  # 8-bit HR value
        hr = int(data[1])
    return max(0, min(255, hr))  # Clamp to valid range
```

### Connection Management
- **Connection Attempts**: Continuous retry with 5-second intervals
- **Stay Connected**: Maintains connection while receiving notifications
- **Automatic Recovery**: Reconnects automatically after connection loss
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Regular heartbeat signals for service health

## Data Output

### CogniCore Publications

The service publishes biometric data to two Redis hashes in CogniCore:

#### Heart Rate Data (`hr_sensor` hash)
Enhanced heart rate data with advanced physiological metrics:

```json
{
  "hr": 72,
  "t_hr": 1234567890.123,
  "rr_interval": 0.85,
  "baseline_deviation": 0.15,
  "rmssd": 42.5,
  "hr_trend": 1.2,
  "stress_index": 0.25,
  "baseline_hr": 72,
  "baseline_hrv": 45
}
```

**Heart Rate Fields:**
- `hr`: Heart rate in beats per minute (BPM, 0-255)
- `t_hr`: Unix timestamp of measurement
- `rr_interval`: RR interval in seconds for HRV analysis (optional)
- `baseline_deviation`: HR deviation from baseline (0-1)
- `rmssd`: Root Mean Square of Successive Differences in ms
- `hr_trend`: Heart rate trend in BPM per minute
- `stress_index`: Calculated stress level (0-1)
- `baseline_hr`: Individual baseline heart rate
- `baseline_hrv`: Individual baseline HRV

#### Alcohol Detection Data (`alcohol_detected` hash)
Immediate alcohol detection events with precise timestamps:

```json
{
  "detected": true,
  "timestamp": 1758815376.5226352,
  "detection_time": "2025-09-25 17:49:36"
}
```

**Alcohol Detection Fields:**
- `detected`: Always `true` (only published when alcohol is detected)
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp with millisecond precision
- `detection_time`: Human-readable timestamp in local time format

**Publishing Behavior:**
- **Event-Driven**: Only publishes when alcohol is actually detected
